# Standard Go Project Layout

This is a basic layout for Go application projects. Note that it's basic in terms of content because it's focusing only on the general layout and not what you have inside. It's also basic because it's very high level and it doesn't go into great details in terms of how you can structure your project even further. For example, it doesn't try to cover the project structure you'd have with something like Clean Architecture.

This is NOT an official standard defined by the core Go dev team. This is a set of common historical and emerging project layout patterns in the Go ecosystem. Some of these patterns are more popular than others. It also has a number of small enhancements along with several supporting directories common to any large enough real world application.
