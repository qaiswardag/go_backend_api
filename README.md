# About

This project is a decentralized voting system built using the Go programming language and blockchain technology. The system aims to provide a transparent and secure platform for voting processes.

# Features

#### Decentralized Architecture

Utilizes blockchain technology to decentralize the voting process, ensuring transparency and immutability of voting data.

#### Secure Authentication

Implements a robust authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify the identity of voters and prevent unauthorized access.

####

User-friendly Interface
Provides a user-friendly interface for voter registration, login, and casting votes, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for all participants.

#### Transparent Voting Process

Enables voters to cast their votes securely while maintaining transparency and integrity throughout the voting process.

#### Immutable Voting Records

Stores voting data on the blockchain, ensuring that all transactions are recorded immutably and cannot be altered or tampered with.

#### Auditable and Verifiable

Facilitates auditing and verification of election results by allowing stakeholders to access and validate voting records on the blockchain.

# Technology Stack

#### Go Programming Language

Utilizes Go for backend development, leveraging its performance, concurrency support, and simplicity.

#### Chi Router

Uses the Chi router for routing HTTP requests and handling RESTful APIs efficiently.

#### GORM

Integrates the GORM package for database operations and user management tasks, ensuring seamless interaction with the underlying database.

#### Blockchain Integration

Interacts with blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum) using appropriate packages (e.g., go-ethereum) for storing voting data securely.

#### Authentication

Implements secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and session management.

#### Cryptography

Utilizes cryptographic primitives from Go's standard library for secure data encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
